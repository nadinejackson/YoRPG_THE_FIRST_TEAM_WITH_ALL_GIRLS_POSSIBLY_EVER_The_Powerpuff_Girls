# yoRPG_THE_FIRST_TEAM_WITH_ALL_GIRLS_POSSIBLY_EVER_The_Powerpuff_Girls-
An amazing new role-playing game with epic battles, satisfying victories, and crushing losses.

Players of this RPG choose when to use a special attack on an approaching monster and either **slay the monster** or _die themselves_.

###What's New in Version 3?
*New **types of Protagonists** allow the user to choose between the Mafia, [Plague Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor "The Fashionable Beak People") and Witch.
  *The witch, with her experience in surviving a hanging, has a higher defense.
  *The plague doctor, with his/her ~~totally unquestionable~~ doctoring methods and fabulous mask, has a higher HP.
  *The mafia is a stone cold killer who inflicts more damage than other Protagonists.
*New **types of Monsters** will pop up, one being a Moshi Monster, and the other two being Pocket Monsters and Digital Monsters.
  *The Moshi Monsters, being so cute, have a higher defense.
  *The Pocket Monsters, having the power to pop up at random times, have a higher HP.
  *The Digital Monsters, under the control of four evil overlords, have a higher strength.
